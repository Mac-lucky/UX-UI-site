                    <h1>Overview</h1>
                    <p>
                        CodersCrew is getting bigger. We are communicating through Slack, mails, we are creating Google
                        Documents, working in Jira, but there is a need for a platform to organize the organization and
                        better managing. In the future, the site is to be made available to other organizations to help
                        with managing.
                        CodersCrew has its own company image and structure. Work on the website began on the part of UX,
                        under the supervision of PM with the cooperation of programmers and with the help and
                        supervision of the client (management board).

                    <p>
                        Thanks to the platform, the management board of the organization will be able to add members,
                        check payment statuses for membership fees, and approve new projects. Members will be able to
                        create their own profile, join projects or build their business history from initiatives in
                        which they participate.

                    <h1>Research/ Questionnaire/ Analyse</h1>
                    <p>At the very beginning, CoderCrew members were surveyed using Google Surveys.</p>
                    <p>Main conclusions from the surveys:</p>
                    <p> - the section on projects, presentation of projects, description will be important<br>
                        - users have trouble finding information on meeting dates,<br>
                        - people do not know the leaders of the departments, they don’t know to whom to report on
                        various matters<br>
                        - a guide or mentor would be useful to introduce the new member to the association structure</p>
