                        I’ve realised that there in no music app where you can choose the music based on your mood.
                        In others music players it isn’t that easy and simple. The problem was also the level of
                        interaction
                        with other users.

                    <h1>Approach</h1>
                    <p>
                        The app is divided into four different moods distinguished by different styles appropriate to
                        the mood of
                        the user. In every sections you can find different playlists and you can also create and share
                        your own
                        one.

                            “When Spotify launched in 2006, it was clear that the music industry needed some help. Today
                            streaming accounts are 75% of how we listen to music. By the time you’re reading this,
                            Spotify
                            will have roughly 198–210 million users worldwide. Currently, 83 million of them are paid
                            subscribers with numbers expecting to reach 95–100 million by early 2019. With almost twice
                            the
                            number of subscribers than Apple Music, Spotify will remain to be the leader in the paid
                            music
                            streaming market.(...)”

                    I focused on spotify as a champion of music app players. According to Spotify, <b>72% of Spotify

                    45–54-year-olds, 19% 55 and older. Millennials represent the largest user demographic.

                    I’ve made a survey and I’ve sent it to my friends aged 18-24 (20 persons) to ask about their
                    preferences and difficulties in using the mobile music players and to get to know their profile.
