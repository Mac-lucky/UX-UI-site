                        I’ve realised that there in no music app where you can choose the music based on your mood.
                        In others music players it isn’t that easy and simple. The problem was also the level of
                        interaction
                        with other users.

                    <p>
                        The app is divided into four different moods distinguished by different styles appropriate to
                        the mood of
                        the user. In every sections you can find different playlists and you can also create and share
                        your own
                        one.

                            streaming accounts are 75% of how we listen to music. By the time you’re reading this,
                            Spotify
                            will have roughly 198–210 million users worldwide. Currently, 83 million of them are paid
                            subscribers with numbers expecting to reach 95–100 million by early 2019. With almost twice
                            the
                            number of subscribers than Apple Music, Spotify will remain to be the leader in the paid

                        I focused on spotify as a champion of music app players. According to Spotify, <b>72% of Spotify
                            listeners are millennials, with 26% 18–24-year-olds</b>, 29% 25–34-year-olds, 16%
                        35–44-year-olds, 11%
                        45–54-year-olds, 19% 55 and older. Millennials represent the largest user demographic.

                        I’ve made a survey and I’ve sent it to my friends aged 18-24 (20 persons) to ask about their
                        preferences and difficulties in using the mobile music players and to get to know their profile.

                                It came from her love of drawing and creation. In her spare time, she runs an instagram
                                with new drawings,
                                takes pictures and hangs out with her friends and a boyfriend. At weekends Kate is

                                to save some money on travels during breaks.

                        the music all the time- at metro, when she is drawing, with her friends. </p>

                    <h2>Proposed solution</h2>
                    <p>After thinking about Kate problems, I prioritized them and came up with possible solutions. One
                        of the best I wanted to be the basis of a new music player is to divide the app into four
                        different moods. The moods will be distinguished by different styles appropriate to the mood of
                        the user. In every sections Kate could find different playlists and also create and share her
                        own one. The playlists can be filter. The level of interaction with other users will be enhanced
                        by sharing playlists, commenting songs.</p>
