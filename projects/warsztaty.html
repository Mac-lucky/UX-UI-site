            I ‘ve participated in a social hackathon and workshops <span class="lightblue">"Sensorycznie i na
              serio"</span> an event
            dedicated to the
            issue of people with sensory disabilities in the city. The event was held online on the ZOOM platform on
            September 12-13, 2020. After the first half of the day filled with lectures about different aspects of
            poeple with sensory disabilities’s life, I was assigned to a group of three, with whom we were to create a
            product, solving any of the presented problems. The form of the hackathon assumed dealing with the problem
            in a small period of time and using the guidance of mentors.

            Mrs. Dorota Orzeszek in her lecture “How seniors work, i.e. information architecture for the elderly”
            inspired our group with the term “turbo senior”. We’ve decided to get interested in the group of elderly
            people, which deal with sensory disabilities and many more difficulties.

            Due to the form of the hackathon we didn’t have enought time for the perfect UX process. To do better

            data from questionnairies. We could consult ideas with targer group, and test the mockups.
